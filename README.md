cachedive
=========

A viewer of Second Life cache files that works in a web browser without installing any additional software, and without uploading anything.

As far as I know, it currently only works in Google Chrome.

Features
--------

- Several types of cached items can be viewed in the browser, such as sounds, notecards, and the text content of wearables and gestures.
- The cached items may be recovered and saved as files.

Demo

Why
---

After learning that some browsers have added APIs for reading local files, and considering that browsers can play audio from ogg, I thought it would be a cool proof of concept.

What's Missing
--------------

- Images (unfortunately, SL used something called JPEG 2000)
- Animation previews (possible using current web technologies)
- Anything added to SL after 2010
- Date sort, text search, etc.

Note: the author has no plans to make these or any further improvements to this software.
